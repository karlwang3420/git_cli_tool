# GitSwitch Example Configuration
# ================================
# This file configures which repositories to manage and how to switch branches.

# Branches to try when switching (in priority order)
# The tool will try the first branch, then fall back to the next if not found
switch_branches_fallback:
  - "feature/new-feature"  # First priority
  - "develop"              # Second priority (fallback)
  - "main"                 # Third priority (last resort)

# Whether to record history before switching branches
# When true, you can use 'git_cli_tool revert' to go back to previous states
record_history: true

# Repositories to manage
# Format: parent_path -> list of subfolders
# Each subfolder is expected to be a git repository
repositories:
  - "C:/projects/backend":
      - "api-service"
      - "auth-service"
      - "db-service"

  - "C:/projects/frontend":
      - "web-app"
      - "mobile-app"

  - "C:/projects/shared":
      - "common-lib"
      - "config-lib"

# Maps child branches to their parent branches
# When you run 'git_cli_tool sync child-branch', it will merge the parent into it
sync: 
  # Branch dependencies for the 'sync' command
  branch_dependencies:
    "feature/extension": "feature/base"
    "feature/part2": "feature/part1"
    "feature/ui-improvements": "develop"

  # Fallback branch when parent branch is not found (default: "main")
  # If the parent branch doesn't exist in a repo, sync will merge from this branch instead
  fallback_branch: "main"
